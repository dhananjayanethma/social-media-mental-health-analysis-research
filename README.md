# 📱 Exploring the Relationship between Social Media Behaviour and Mental Health Status

## 📌 Overview
This research project investigates the relationship between social media behaviour and users’ mental health status by integrating behavioural tracking, facial expression recognition, and AI-based sentiment analysis. A Flutter-based mobile application was developed to capture real-time user interactions and emotional responses while consuming social media content, enabling early mental health insights and supportive interventions.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Analyze social media scrolling behaviour and user engagement patterns  
- Detect emotional states using facial expression recognition  
- Perform sentiment analysis on social media text using NLP techniques  
- Identify long-term emotional trends using multimodal data fusion  
- Propose AI-based mental health interventions to support emotional well-being

## 🧠 Key Features
- **User Behaviour Tracking**
  - Scroll speed and dwell-time analysis  
  - Screen pause and interaction detection  

- **Facial Expression Recognition (FER)**
  - Real-time emotion detection (Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Disgust, Surprise, Neutral)  
  - CNN and Vision Transformer-based models  

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - Sentiment and emotion analysis of social media text  
  - Deep learning-based text classification  

- **Multimodal Data Fusion**
  - Integration of text, image, facial expression, and behaviour data  
  - Time-series emotional trend analysis  

- **Mental Well-being Interventions**
  - Virtual pet interaction  
  - Positive content recommendations  
  - Social media break suggestions

- Secure handling of facial and behavioural data  
- Ethical use of AI for mental health monitoring  
- Transparency in data collection and analysis  

---

## 📈 Results & Discussion
The findings indicate that:
- Visual and textual social media content significantly influence emotional states  
- Prolonged exposure to negative content correlates with emotional distress  
- Scroll behaviour patterns reflect user engagement and mood  
- Multimodal analysis improves the accuracy of mental health assessment  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
